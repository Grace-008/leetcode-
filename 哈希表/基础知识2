1.defaultdict allows you to specify a default value that should be returned when you try to access a non-existent key. 

from collections import defaultdict

d = defaultdict(int)   # Default value is 0
d['a'] += 1             # Accesses non-existent key 'a' and assigns it the default value 0
print(d['a'])          # Output: 1

while in a standard dict, if you try to access a key that does not exist, a KeyError will be raised. For example:

d = {}
d['a']   # Raises KeyError: 'a'

As a result, you cannot write the code like that because if the key num doesn't already exist in the dictionary val_index_dict, 

then the val_index_dict[num] statement will raise a KeyError.


2. enumerate is a built-in Python function that is used to iterate over a sequence 

(such as a list, tuple, or string) while also keeping track of the current index of the iteration.

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
for i, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(i, fruit)

0 apple
1 banana
2 orange

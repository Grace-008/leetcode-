First, it checks if the length of the list is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns the length of the list because any subsequence in a list of length 0 or 1 is already increasing.

The variables count and ans are initialized to 1 because any single number is a subsequence of length 1, and we need to keep track of the length of the longest increasing subsequence seen so far.

The for loop iterates through the list starting from index 1.

If the current number is greater than the previous number, that means the current subsequence is increasing. So, we increment count.

If the current number is not greater than the previous number, that means the current subsequence is not increasing. So, we reset count to 1.

At each iteration, we update ans to be the maximum value seen so far between ans and count.

Finally, the function returns ans, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the list.
